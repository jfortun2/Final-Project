                        Due to the foul conditions that plagued Pittsburgh for over a century it was once known as the “Smoky City” or “Hell With the Lid Off”. 
                        Its geographic location and natural resources made it an ideal home for the industries that inevitably created the pollution problem. 
                        The city’s dark past has been described as a cautionary tale for cities lacking environmental control.

                        In 1762 a coal mining seam was discovered along the south bank of the Monongahela River.  
                        Smoke pollution was the most noticeable effect of coal consumption and gave the city its identity as the “City of Smoke.”
                        The rivers were a popular transportation route and disposal location for sewage. This caused them to become highly contaminated. 
                        In 1880, Pittsburgh had hundreds of boats struggling to navigate the crowded rivers. 
                        Between 1872 and 1908 the city had the highest typhoid fever mortality rate of any city in the nation. 
                        An individual in Pittsburgh was three times more likely to die of typhoid fever.
                         Sewage discharge into the rivers was one of the contributing factors to the problem.  
                         This was also where The city drew its water supply making the sewage discharge into it all the more hazardous.

                        In 1762 a coal mining seam was discovered along the south bank of the Monongahela River.  
                        Smoke pollution was the most noticeable effect of coal consumption and gave the city its identity as the “City of Smoke.”
                        The rivers were a popular transportation route and disposal location for sewage. This caused them to become highly contaminated. 
                        In 1880, Pittsburgh had hundreds of boats struggling to navigate the crowded rivers. 
                        Between 1872 and 1908 the city had the highest typhoid fever mortality rate of any city in the nation. 
                        An individual in Pittsburgh was three times more likely to die of typhoid fever.
                         Sewage discharge into the rivers was one of the contributing factors to the problem.  
                         This was also where The city drew its water supply making the sewage discharge into it all the more hazardous.
