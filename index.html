                            Due to the foul conditions that plagued Pittsburgh for over a century it was once known as the “Smoky City” or “Hell With the Lid Off”. 
                            Its geographic location and natural resources made it an ideal home for the industries that inevitably created the pollution problem. 
                            The city’s dark past has been described as a cautionary tale for cities lacking environmental control.

                            In 1762 a coal mining seam was discovered along the south bank of the Monongahela River.  
                            Smoke pollution was the most noticeable effect of coal consumption and gave the city its identity as the “City of Smoke.”
                            The rivers were a popular transportation route and disposal location for sewage. This caused them to become highly contaminated. 
                            In 1880, Pittsburgh had hundreds of boats struggling to navigate the crowded rivers.

                                Between 1872 and 1908 the city had the highest typhoid fever mortality rate of any city in the nation. 
                                An individual in Pittsburgh was three times more likely to die of typhoid fever.
                                Sewage discharge into the rivers was one of the contributing factors to the problem.  
                                This was also where The city drew its water supply making the sewage discharge into it all the more hazardous.

                                There were efforts made in the 1800s to reduce air pollution. 
                                Unfortunately, they were rarely enforced. 
                                Smoke control ordinances and the Bureau of Smoke Control were introduced. 
                                Also not very successfully due to lack of proper regulations, enforcement, and control technologies.
                                It was difficult to convince residents that the smoke was a problem. 
                                Many people felt the smoke was a sign of productivity and prosperity. 
                                They believed the smoke was good for their lungs and helped crops grow.

                        <p class="Eventtext">	
                            The smoke had many devastating effects on the city and the way people lived. 
                            Some of the most famous were the conditions downtown at midday when street lights had to be turned on. 
                            The vegetation around the city was also affected; in contrast to the very green city of today, before smoke-control many of the hills were completely denuded by the fumes.
                            There was acid rain before they even invented the term.

                    <h3>Profit over Health</h3>

                        <p class="Eventtext">

                            “The Pittsburgher insists that the smoke of bituminous coal kills malaria and saves the eyesight.
                            The smoke, so far from being an evil, is a blessing, and it destroys every property of the atmosphere that is hostile to life.” 
                    
                            A report of the Mellon Institute—a six-volume study done between 1910 and 1914—focused on the economic costs of smoke; 
                            researchers had to downplay its health costs because they could not determine any of air pollution's relationships to various diseases.
                            They concluded that although Pittsburghers had mottled lungs, this was not dangerous to their health because of what they called “pulmonary anthacosis,” 
                            or formation of lesions that allegedly warded off bacteria and promoted healing in the case of tuberculosis.

                        Not willing to cripple such an important part of the local economy, it promised to clean the air by using treated local coal.

                        The 1948 Donora smog was the worst air pollution disaster in U.S. history. 
                        It jumpstarted the fields of environmental and public health, drew attention to the need for industrial regulation, and launched a national conversation about the effects of pollution. 
                        But in doing so, it pitted industry against the health of humans and their environment.</p>

                        Yellow fog swept over the Pittsburgh neighbor.
                        On Saturday October 30, around 2 a.m., the first death occurred. 
                        Within days, 19 more people from Donora and Webster were dead. 
                        The funeral homes ran out of caskets; florists ran out of flowers. 
                        Hundreds flooded the hospitals, gasping for air, while hundreds more with respiratory or cardiac conditions were advised to evacuate the city. 
                        It wasn’t until the rain arrived at midday on Sunday that the fog finally dissipated.

                         This was also where The city drew its water supply making the sewage discharge into it all the more hazardous.
