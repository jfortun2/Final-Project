      <h1>The Smoky City</h1>
        <img class = "headerimg" src= "Assets/Polution Problem 1.jpeg" alt="Man standing in smoggy Pittsburgh">

        <p>Due to the foul conditions that plagued Pittsburgh for over a century it was once known as the “Smoky City” or “Hell With the Lid Off”.
          Its geographic location and natural resources made it an ideal home for the industries that inevitably created the pollution problem.
          The city’s dark past has been described as a cautionary tale for cities lacking environmental control. 
          Pittsburgh has an extremely long history of pollution and the struggle to alleviate it.</p>

        <p>In 1762 a coal mining seam was discovered along the south bank of the Monongahela River.
           This resulted in some of the biggest and longest lasting impacts on our environment. 
           Coal was an important energy source that fueled the industrialization of the country. However, 
           Pittsburgh’s environment certainly paid the price. Smoke pollution was the most noticeable effect of coal consumption and gave the city its identity as the “City of Smoke.”
           The rivers were a popular transportation route and disposal location for sewage. This caused them to become highly contaminated. In 1880, Pittsburgh had hundreds of boats struggling to navigate the crowded rivers. Between 1872 and 1908 the city had the highest typhoid fever mortality rate of any city in the nation. An individual in Pittsburgh was three times more likely to die of typhoid fever. Sewage discharge into the rivers was one of the contributing factors to the problem.  
           This was also where The city drew its water supply making the sewage discharge into it all the more hazardous.
           There were efforts made in the 1800s to reduce air pollution.
           Unfortunately, they were rarely enforced. 
           Smoke control ordinances and the Bureau of Smoke Control were introduced. 
           Also not very successfully due to lack of proper regulations, enforcement, and control technologies. 
           It was difficult to convince residents that the smoke was a problem. 
           Many people felt the smoke was a sign of productivity and prosperity.
           They believed the smoke was good for their lungs and helped crops grow. 
           Pittsburgh’s dark haze inspired many poems and was an important part of the city’s identity.</p>
