      <h1>The Smoky City</h1>
        <img class = "headerimg" src= "Assets/Polution Problem 1.jpeg" alt="Man standing in smoggy Pittsburgh">

        <p>Due to the foul conditions that plagued Pittsburgh for over a century it was once known as the “Smoky City” or “Hell With the Lid Off”.
          Its geographic location and natural resources made it an ideal home for the industries that inevitably created the pollution problem.
          The city’s dark past has been described as a cautionary tale for cities lacking environmental control. 
          Pittsburgh has an extremely long history of pollution and the struggle to alleviate it.</p>
