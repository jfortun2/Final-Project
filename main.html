                    <p>If you flip back to the masthead
                        in the early pages of this magazine, you will notice that
                        the headquarters office of the Air & Waste Management
                        Association (A&WMA) is located in downtown Pittsburgh,
                        PA. Why is the office of this international organization found
                        in this particular city? Why not Los Angeles, or Chicago, or
                        London, or Buenos Aires? The answer is that Pittsburgh is
                        both unique and representative of other cities; historically,
                        it was the location of some of the nation’s worst air quality
                        and best innovations in control. But Pittsburgh’s story might
                        also be instructive in understanding broader themes in pollution and its management.
                        Historians have emphasized four
                        general themes in describing Pittsburgh’s pollution history:
                        nature, geography, and geology; economy and technology;
                        politics and citizens; and science and policy. These themes
                        may be extended to facilitate a broader understanding of the
                        history of the environment in many cities.</p>
